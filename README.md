# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a line of their symbols ('X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game features interactive gameplay, win detection, and a reset function for replayability.
